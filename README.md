<h4 align="left">Hi there, welcome!</h4>

###

<div align="left">
  
I’m a Front-end developer with a degree in Software Engineering — passionate about creating modern, intuitive, and interactive interfaces. I enjoy working with modern technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the field.

Writing clean code and following SOLID principles are essential to me, regardless of the project. Besides Front-end development, I also have experience with Back-end and have worked with different software architectures. Infrastructure and DevOps are part of my daily workflow, giving me a broad and complete view of the development process.

I love what I do — and when I’m not coding, I’m probably studying. It’s a hobby that only loses to gaming.
